## üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting Features

The implementation includes smart rate limiting to protect your free tier:

- **Daily Limit**: 10 emails per day
- **Monthly Limit**: 200 emails per month  
- **Local Storage**: Tracks usage client-side
- **Graceful Handling**: Shows clear error messages when limits are reached
- **Usage Counter**: Displays remaining quota after successful sends

## üîß Template Variables Available

Your EmailJS template can use these variables:
- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email  
- `{{subject}}` - Message subject
- `{{message}}` - Message content
- `{{to_name}}` - Your name (Janitha Gamage)
- `{{reply_to}}` - Sender's email for replies

## üìä Monitoring Usage

- Usage is tracked in browser's localStorage
- Counters reset automatically (daily/monthly)
- Form shows helpful error messages when limits reached
- Check browser console for detailed EmailJS logs

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Form shows "Configuration Error"
- Check that all environment variables are set
- Restart development server after adding env vars
- Verify EmailJS service/template IDs are correct

### "Failed to Send Message"  
- Check EmailJS dashboard for service status
- Verify email service credentials are still valid
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure Gmail/Outlook hasn't revoked app permissions

### Rate Limit Messages
- Wait for daily/monthly reset
- Or temporarily increase limits in the code
- Consider upgrading to EmailJS paid plan if needed

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Email Service**: Use Gmail with App Passwords for reliability
2. **Template Testing**: Test templates in EmailJS dashboard first
3. **Error Handling**: Monitor browser console during testing  
4. **Backup Plan**: Always provide direct email as fallback
5. **Security**: Never expose service credentials in client code

## üîÑ Migration to Paid Plan

If you exceed free tier limits:
- **Personal Plan**: $15/month for 1,000 emails
- Increase daily/monthly limits in the code
- No code changes needed, just environment config
