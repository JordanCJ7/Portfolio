# Janitha Gamage Portfolio: Modern Next.js Portfolio with AI

Janitha Gamage Portfolio is a sleek, modern, and AI-enhanced personal portfolio website template. Built with Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Genkit for AI-powered copywriting assistance. It's designed to help developers and creatives showcase their work, skills, and personality in a professional and engaging way.

## Project Overview

This project provides a ready-to-use portfolio website with several key sections:

*   **Homepage:** A captivating hero section to introduce yourself.
*   **Projects Page:** A filterable and searchable gallery to showcase your work.
*   **AI Copywriting Assistant:** A tool leveraging Genkit and Google's Gemini model to help refine project descriptions or other text.
*   **Contact Page:** A form for visitors to get in touch.

The application emphasizes modern web development practices, including server components, responsive design, and a focus on user experience with subtle animations and a clean dark-mode aesthetic.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-pro.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd portfolio-pro
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example (if one exists) or creating it from scratch. Add the following variables:

    ```env
    # Required for Genkit AI features
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here

    # Optional: Rate Limiting for AI Assistant (defaults are low for testing)
    # Consult Google AI documentation for actual free tier limits (e.g., Gemini API might be 60 RPM)
    GEMINI_RPM_LIMIT=5  # Requests Per Minute
    GEMINI_RPD_LIMIT=20 # Requests Per Day
    ```
    *   You can obtain a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the Genkit Development Server:**
    The AI features require a separate Genkit development server. Open a new terminal window and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for automatic reloading on changes to AI flow files:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This server typically runs on `http://localhost:3400` by default.

5.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    In another terminal window, start the Next.js application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually start the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per `package.json`).

6.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in your terminal).

You should now have the Janitha Gamage Portfolio application running locally.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
Then, to start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```
Ensure your environment variables are correctly set up in your production environment. The Genkit flows would typically be deployed as part of your backend infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) for a production setup. The `genkit:dev` server is for local development.
